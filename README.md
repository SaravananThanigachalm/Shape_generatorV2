# Shape_generatorV2
Hey this is Saravanan again @ day 4 of 100DaysOfCode
I don't quit that easy, so here it is a much improved version of Shape generator V1 with almost zero bugs and I changed my IDE as it caused half of the bug in the previous version, a lesson learnt the hard way :(
HappyCoding :-}
